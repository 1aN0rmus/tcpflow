Timeline for 1.4 ship:


- mfs - Document the refactored class hiearchy for one-page-report.
      - Abstract class represents each rectangular region of report & gets packets
      - Specialized classes for:
        - time histogram (not templated initially) 
        - time histogram data element
        - iptree (templated at the moment)
        - port histogram
      - slg will look at before mfs begins refactoring


Features needed:
================
- Packet Grid
- Documentation (NPS Report)


What we are not doing:
======================
- Traffic Map
- Language identification
- Keyword extraction & clustering
- Passive DNS


Test Plan:
==========
- Performance testing

Packaging:
----------
- Put relevant boost headers in boost subdirectory

Compile testing:
----------------
Make sure that it compiles on these platforms:
- FC17
- Ubuntu
- OS10.6, 10.8
- cygwin
- mingw
- Centos 5.8
- Centos 6.0
- SUSE


Reliability testing:
--------------------
Test for crashing with all scanners on with specific data sets:
- no packets
- Lincoln Labs ID98 
   - One day
   - All of the packets concatenated together
- Lincoln Labs ID99 (All of the packets concatenated together)
   - One day
   - All of the packets concatenated together
- One day from ID98 & One day from ID99
- M57 Patents
  - One day
  - All packets concatenated together
- NGDC 2012 
  - All packets concatenated together

- Cada?

Correctness testing:
--------------------
Create a file of all MD5s of all TCP streams. Sort the file. Use "diff"

Data Sets for comparison:
- ID98 one day
- M57 one day

Compare results of:
- tcpflow 1.4 with tcpflow 1.0
- Question: Can Suricata provide the MD5 of tcp streams?



Packaging:
----------
- .tar.gz file distributed on digitalcorpora.
- windows executables on digitalcorpora
- downloadable tag from github
