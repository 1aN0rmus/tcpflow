I'm pleased to announce the release of tcpflow version 1.4.0.

Key elements in 1.4.0 include:

Completely rewritten TCP implementation that:

* Handles TCP flows larger than 4GiB

* Handles TCP packets sent after a connection is closed. Such packets are
  compared with the packets from the connection that were already
  received. If the packets match, they are discarded as
  retransmissions. If they do not match they are put in new transcript
  files.

Completely rewritten HTTP parser

* Handles multiple HTTP objects per connections

* Optional http_cmd will run a program or script for each HTTP
  attachment received as received. For example, to run the program
  /bin/echo and provide the filename of the attachment for each
  attachment, specify:

      tcpflow -Shttp_cmd=/bin/echo ...


New Scalability features:

* Automatically creates new directories as necessary for output
  filenames that include forward slashes ("/").

* -Fk option automatically bins up to a thousand flows in a thousand
   directories in one directory layer, easily handling up to million
   flows.

* -Fm option automatically bins up to a thousand flows in a million
   directories (two directory layers), easily handling up to billion flows.

* -Fg option automatically bins up to a thousand flows in a billion
   directories (three directory layers), easily handling up to trillion flows.

Additional features:

* Produces a one-page visualization (report.pdf) of the packets that
  were analyzed.

* New -w option writes a PCAP file of packets not processed by tcpflow.

* Better support for decoding and decompressing HTTP objects,
  including multiple objects sent over a single HTTP stream.

* Full support for the bulk_extractor plug-in system
