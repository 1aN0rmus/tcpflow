Accomplished for 1.4:

+ update tcpip structure to indicate if a SYN was seen; If packets arrive before the beginning of the connection and a SYN was not seen, insert in the beginning of the file.
+ remove syn_set from store_packet. Make sure that it's called when we know the packet offset.
 
================================================================

- discover and create MIME objects.
- Run a subprocess when each file is opened or closed.
- Regression testing by randomizing packet order and making sure that the results are the same.
================
Here is my currently plan for the plugin approach:

-Ps "command"   --- Run command at the start of each flow; pipe the flow to stdin
-Pe "command"   --- Run command at the end of each flow; pipe the flow to stdin (from the file)
-PE "command"  ---  Run command at the end of each flow, but do not pipe flow to stdin

Substitution options for command:

%t - time_t of the flow start
%T - ISO8601 time for the flow start
%s - source IP address
%S - source Port
%d - destination IP address
%D - destination IP port
%l - length of the flow (only useful for -Pe, of course)
%f - filename of the flow
